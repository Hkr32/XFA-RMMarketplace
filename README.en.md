## Requirements

## Description

RM Marketplace allows you and/or your users to sell resources from the resource manager, like in a marketplace!

NOW supporting xF Payment profiles since V5.0.0.

Supports three types of products :

- Digital products (license based):
  - with or without license renewal
  - with or without licence restrictions
  - with or without url required to download
- Physical products
- Service offers

Based on either custom Paypal solution or XenForo payment profiles.

Through the Resource Categories configuration system, the administrator select which categories are intended for the sale of resources and the type of products that can be put for sale among the ones here above.
Each of these categories can be set to either:

- use the paypal address or xF payment profiles set in the admincp through options;
- use the paypal address or xF payment profiles set for that category;
- let each user input their own paypal address or xF payment profiles to sell their resources.

You can also allow your user to accept other payment means (cash, western union, check...) through exchanges between the buyer and the seller.

When adding a resource to these categories, your users can then select wether or not they want to sell it or not.

Along with the capability to sell resources, RM Marketplace is also a true source of monetization for you, and that thanks to two features:

- You can require a percentage on sales, automatically retrieved upon payment (for paypal payments only) or automatically invoiced every month (for xF payment profiles).
- You can provide users with the capability to pay to have their resource featured on the resource manager index and categories pages.
